5,186c0158aab00d4e,['Archana Sikhar Chand <asikharc@uci.edu>'],['Fwd: Request for Instructors for CHC Sustainable Societies Sequence']," forwarded message   from: michael dennin   vice provost, teaching & learning and dean, division of undergraduate education <zotmail@uci.edu> date: tue, 7 mar 2023, 6:30 pm subject: request for instructors for chc sustainable societies sequence to: senate faculty & unit 18 lecturers, all graduate students, sender custom email list <zotmail@uci.edu> *requesting instructors for the chc sustainable societies sequence* dear colleagues, since the fall of 2017, campuswide honors students have had the choice of two course sequences that build on humanities core to fulfill their general education requirements: the classic track and sustainable societies. sustainable societies is a six quarter, interdisciplinary sequence of courses. these courses are team taught, problem based, and structured to use active learning as much as possible (all classes are currently held in the alp). you can get a brief, high level sense of the courses in the sequence by visiting the sustainable societies webpage <https://zotmail.oit.uci.edu/public/clickmessage.aspx?linkid=3a1ad936 270e 4452 b960 e7f864dc2288&zotmailid=l+ddaee1tr1iarzbnsacyw==>. this is a wonderful sequence to teach, and it fills an important role for a large cohort of chc students (70% of whom are first generation and who, thanks to being in the chc, have now been shown to be substantially more likely to graduate in four years). the enrollment in the sustainable societies courses is now about 80, which is small for ge courses. in addition to being great courses to teach, these courses are good for the faculty teaching them as well as their departments. faculty teaching in the sustainable societies sequence have their teaching credited to their normal teaching load. in addition, like faculty teaching in the classic track, those teaching in sustainable societies get a $1,500 research fund as a chc fellow. although these courses are listed as “unistu” courses, the schools/departments that provide the faculty to teach them receive the student credit hours. also, the provost has established that, even though these courses are team taught, the faculty members teaching them (and their departments/schools) are each credited with full, not partial, credit for the students in it. finally, the chc pays for a ta for these courses drawn from the disciplines of the faculty involved. in a few cases where this model has not worked, the chc has supported faculty directly with research funding. below is a brief description of what we are looking for in each of these courses. we are looking for both senate faculty and for graduate students (to serve as teaching associates) to be part of the teaching team. please contact ted wright (cewright@uci.edu) for more information or if you have any questions. *h30a: critical analysis of health science literature* this is the first course in this sequence, and it has been wonderfully taught for the last six years by angela jenks (anthropology) and amanda holton (chemistry), who are now rotating out. the focus of the course is health challenges facing societies today and how they might be solved. in addition, the course should also introduce students to the evaluation of scientific literature and the scientific method, including scientific research design, statistical analysis, and publication processes. within these broad constraints, whoever is teaching h30a would be free to choose the material to teach. at this point, sam schriner (pharmaceutical sciences) has agreed to be the “stem” member of this teaching team to take over next fall. we are looking for someone who has interests in health and medicine and a perspective reflecting humanities, sociology, or anthropology to partner with him. *h30b c: environmental issues affecting the sustainability of societies* this two quarter course is taught by a team of three instructors. as the name implies, the course focuses on problems such as water, food, energy, and climate. it explores the science and models underlying these problems along with the social and technical constraints limiting their solutions. currently taught by julie ferguson (ess) and luyi gui (business), we are looking for a third instructor (or possibly a graduate teaching associate) with a strong policy background in this area. *h30d: social science perspectives on the sustainability of societies* this course is taught in the fall of the second year of the sequence. it looks at how a society’s economic, political, and social organizational choices influence the well being of its citizens. this is content that can be framed in many ways. this course was previously taught by ted wright (cognitive sciences) and brian jenkins (economics). when brian had to step down, he was ably replaced by a graduate teaching associate from political science. but with ted set to retire, we need to start building a new team. *h30e f cities: focal point for sustainability problems and solutions* this is also a two quarter course taught by a team of three instructors. students in this course learn about the important role that cities play in modern societies and the challenges that they create. reflecting its place as the capstone of this sequence, in most of the spring quarter students work in small groups to create policy papers that outline and evaluate possible solutions to actual problems faced by governments, non profits, or companies in a specific urban context, preferably in southern california. the team teaching this course—michael hyland (civil and environmental engineering), who will be on leave next year, brian tarroja (civil and environmental engineering), and a graduate teaching associate from social ecology—would benefit from the addition of someone with a policy or social perspective on one or more urban issues. if you are interested in joining a sustainable societies teaching team, please contact ted wright
